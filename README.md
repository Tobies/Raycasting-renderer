# Raycasting-renderer
An attempt at implementing a raycaster that will draw fake 3d enviroment, inspired by DOOM's render engine
Using JavaScript, p5.js 

Movement using the W A S D keys and aiming using the mouse
Note that the right side of the screen is a top down view of the map and the left side is the renderer's output

Known bug: the renderer applies a fish eye effect which makes it flicker while moving.
